# Client-Server Application

This is a simple client-server application built using Python. The server handles requests from the client, and the client communicates with the server over a network. This project demonstrates basic network programming concepts using Python's `socket` library.

## Features of Application
- Server listens for incoming client connections.
- Client sends requests/messages to the server.
- Server processes requests and sends responses back to the client.
- Built entirely in Python for simplicity and portability.
